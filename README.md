# L-2-Projection
This is a C program for the L^2 Projection from Finite Element Methods.

You can run this just like any other c program, and this one can accept arguments.

The arguments must be a well-formatted expression of a function with x as the independent value.
For example:

> ./a.out x ^ 2 + 3.14

It will create 4 text documents with the 4 outputs.
